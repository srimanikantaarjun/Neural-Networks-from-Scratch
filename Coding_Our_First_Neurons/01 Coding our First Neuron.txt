Let’s say we have a single neuron, and there are three inputs to this neuron : [1, 2, 3] 

Each input also needs a weight associated with it : [0.2, 0.8, -0.5] 

Since we’re modeling a single neuron, we only have one bias : 2 

Neuron output : 2.3 

What if we have N number of inputs . . . 

N = 5
Inputs = [4, 57, 37, 36, 84]
Weights = [0.6854648885394528, -0.5979721689771043, -0.3209605818459047, 0.5177930261919403, 0.7478832056548108]
Bias = 0.006526732901407151
2.3000000000000003
