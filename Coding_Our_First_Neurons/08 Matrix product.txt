The matrix product is an operation in which we have 2 matrices, and we are performing dot products of all combinations 
of rows from the first matrix and the columns of the 2nd matrix, resulting in a matrix of those atomic dot products.

Row vector : [[1 2 3]] 

We can create a row vector using np.expand_dims() as well adding an extra dimension along the 1st dimension (axis = 0).

Using np.expand_dims() : [[1 2 3]] 

We can create a column vector by applying transposition method to a list/1D - array/1D - vector.
Column vector :
 [[2]
 [3]
 [4]] 

Dot product (technically matrix product) of a row vector and column vector : 20
NumPy does not have a dedicated method for performing matrix product â€” the dot product and matrix product are both implemented in a single method: np.dot()
