Inputs : [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 2.5] 

Weights : [[0.2, 0.8, -0.5, 1], [0.5, -0.91, 0.26, -0.5], [-0.26, -0.27, 0.17, 0.87]] 

Bias : [2.0, 3.0, 0.5] 

Layer outputs by dot product using numpy : [4.8   1.21  2.385] 

To explain the order of parameters we are passing into np.dot(), we should think of it as whatever comes first will decide the output shape. 
In our case, we are passing a list of neuron weights first and then the inputs, as our goal is to get a list of neuron outputs. 
As we mentioned, a dot product of a matrix and a vector results in a list of dot products. 
The np.dot() method treats the matrix as a list of vectors and performs a dot product of each of those vectors with the other vector. 
In this example, we used that property to pass a matrix, which was a list of neuron weight vectors and a vector of inputs and get a list of dot products â€” neuron outputs.
