# Neural-Networks-from-Scratch
I will be implementing Neural Networks from scratch (using basic Python and NumPy functions inspired by professor Dr. Muhammad Aminul Islam and Dr. Andrej Karpathy)

## Why not use libraries like everyone does? It is easy.
* Implementing any algorithm/model using libraries is like building a car with ~Robots and heavy machinery~. Easy and all we need to do is sit back and relax
* On the other hand, implementing an algorithm with as intricate as possible from scratch is like building a car with our own hand (Tip: We know where it went wrong, Easy to debug). Not easy to make. Takes time. We cannot sit back and relax. We fine-tune every aspect of it (My favorite part about doing something from scratch).

I would love to pick your brain and get mine picked as well🤖✍🏼
